STAT 231 focused on a systematic, data-driven approach to empirical problem solving, equipping students with the skills to critically evaluate sampling methods, identify potential sources of error, and assess the validity of causal claims in empirical studies.

Key topics included:
- Review of named distributions from STAT 230 with real-world population applications  
- Numerical and graphical methods for data summarization and model assessment  
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for point and interval estimation  
- Hypothesis testing with emphasis on interpreting confidence intervals and p-values  
- Introduction and applications of the chi-squared and t-distributions  
- Likelihood ratio tests  
- Contingency tables and Gaussian response models, including two-sample Gaussian comparisons and simple linear regression

As a Teaching Assistant, I supported student learning through grading, tutorials, and office hours, ensuring strong comprehension of statistical reasoning and practical data analysis techniques.
