This course introduced key statistical concepts and methodologies tailored for engineering applications. Covered topics included:

- Frequency distributions and data visualization  
- Measures of central tendency and variability (e.g., mean, standard deviation)  
- Fundamentals of probability theory  
- Discrete and continuous probability distributions:
  - Binomial, Poisson, and Normal distributions  
- Sampling techniques and statistical estimation
