Taught a wide range of high school mathematics courses from Grades 9 to 12, covering both foundational and advanced topics. Areas of instruction included Statistics, Probability, Combinatorics, Enumeration, Algebra, Calculus, and Algorithmic Thinking. Focused on fostering strong conceptual understanding, analytical skills, and academic confidence through interactive lessons, customized teaching strategies, and consistent assessment and feedback practices.
