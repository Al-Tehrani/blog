ðŸ“š Course Title & Code
======
**STAT 331 â€“ Applied Linear Models**

ðŸ§¾ Course Description (Content Summary)
======
This course focused on modeling the relationship between a response variable and multiple explanatory variables using linear regression techniques. Students learned to apply statistical models to real-world data and evaluate their effectiveness.

Key topics included:
- Multiple linear regression and the least squares method for parameter estimation  
- Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals for model parameters  
- Model diagnostics and assumptions checking (e.g., residual analysis, multicollinearity)  
- Model refinement and improvement techniques  
- Variable selection algorithms (e.g., forward selection, backward elimination)  
- Introduction to nonlinear regression models and alternative modeling approaches

As a Teaching Assistant, I provided support through tutorials, office hours, and assignment grading, helping students grasp theoretical concepts and develop practical modeling skills using tools such as R.
