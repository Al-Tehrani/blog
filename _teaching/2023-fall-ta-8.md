**STAT 230 â€“ Probability**

ðŸ§¾ Course Description (Content Summary)
======
This undergraduate course introduced students to fundamental probability models and concepts. Key topics included:

- Sample spaces, events, and probability axioms  
- Mutually exclusive and independent events  
- Conditional probability and Bayes' Theorem  
- Common discrete and continuous distributions such as:  
  - Discrete Uniform, Hypergeometric, Binomial, Negative Binomial, Geometric, Poisson  
  - Continuous Uniform, Exponential, Normal (Gaussian), Multinomial  
- Univariate and multivariate random variables  
- Joint, marginal, and conditional probability distributions  
- Expected value, variance, and covariance  
- Applications of the **Central Limit Theorem** for probability approximations  

As a Teaching Assistant, I supported students in understanding theoretical foundations, guided them through problem-solving sessions, and provided feedback on assessments to enhance their learning experience.
