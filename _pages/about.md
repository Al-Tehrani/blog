## This page is still under construction
I'm **AL Tehrani**, a data scientist and software developer with a strong foundation in statistics, computer engineering, and machine learning. I recently completed my **MMath in Data Science at the University of Waterloo**, where my thesis focused on **Interpretable Machine Learning (IML)** methods for building transparent and trustworthy models.

This website serves as a portfolio of my academic background, professional experience, and personal projects. Youâ€™ll find details about my:

- **Publications and Thesis**
- **Teaching and Research Assistantships**
- **Software Development and Data Science Projects**
- **Talks and Presentations**
- **CV and Skills**

I am passionate about building data-driven solutions that combine robust statistical methods with scalable software development. I am particularly interested in applying machine learning to real-world challenges, with a focus on ethical AI and model interpretability.

Please feel free to explore my work and reach out through the contact section if you'd like to collaborate, connect, or just say hi.

Thanks for visiting!
